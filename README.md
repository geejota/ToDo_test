# ToDo_test
 A simple tool for ToDo lists


This ToDo tool was developt in about 3 hours, written only with html, js and css.
The main function here is to add a task, automatically add to first box, then, just intuitively change the status, if is in progress or done, by just dragin the current card. 
You also can delete just clicking the X blue dot, in which card.


In this particular test, proposal by Esparta Co, was asked in this following link: https://github.com/esparta-io/intership
I tried before to do with reactjs, but I am still learning about styled components, so, because I have no fluency in this second lib, it would not make difference between create everything by jsx, or get DOM elements to stylize every div. So I decide to get along well with the old and friendly html.


For the test,  in short, it was create a ToDo tool, where you can add a task, finished a task, and see all your tasks. It was not neede to storage in any db, so if you refresh, you lost all data.

You can access a live version on http://geejota.com/todo/ or https://codepen.io/gustavo-jitsuchaku/pen/KKVKLYK (for some unknowing reason, the addTask button didnt get the align style on codepen, but on my own website, it works well)
